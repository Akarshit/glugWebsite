###Software Freedom Day

Software Freedom Day (SFD) is an annual worldwide celebration of Free Software. SFD is a public education effort with the aim of increasing awareness of Free Software and its virtues, and encouraging its use.  
  
Software Freedom Day was established in 2004 and was first observed on 28 August of that year. About 12 teams participated in the first Software Freedom Day. Since that time it has grown in popularity and every year we have more than 300 events organized by over 100 cities from the world.

SFD will be celebrated at National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur on 17th September, 2016.
GLUG-NITH will be organising various events(including fun events) and workshops to unravel the power of FOSS and Open Source. We also aim to promote the use of Linux.

You might now be wondering what FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) is and what all this hype is about.  
**Free Software** is:
* Free to use
* Free to study
* Free to distribute
* Free to modify
* Free to access
* Free to share
