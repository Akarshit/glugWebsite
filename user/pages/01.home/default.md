# Welcome to GLUG-NITH!
## GNU/Linux User Group NIT Hamirpur

Our GLUG is mainly designed to cater to the GNU/Linux related needs of the students, faculty, staff, and anybody else belonging to NIT Hamirpur. We are a heterogeneous mixture of people ranging from the beta testers and kernel hackers to the fresh-faced newbies, held together together by a common love for GNU/Linux in particular and Free Software in general. 

!!! GLUG NITH is a moniker for the GNU/Linux User Group of National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur.

### What is GNU?


> "GNU, which stands for Gnu's Not Unix, is the name for the complete Unix-compatible software system which I am writing so that I can give it away free to everyone who can use it. Several other volunteers are helping me. Contributions of time, money, programs and equipment are greatly needed."

> <cite> Richard M. Stallman </cite>
